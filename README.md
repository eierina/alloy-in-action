## Introduction

The **"In REVM We Rust"** blog series delves into using the Rust-based Ethereum Virtual Machine (REVM) for simulating Ethereum transactions, exploring the mempool, and analyzing MEV opportunities. This repository provides the Rust source code examples discussed in the blog posts, enabling readers to follow along and experiment on their own.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each blog post in the series:

- `todo/` - *TODO*

Each directory contains the Rust source code relevant to that particular post.

## Getting Started
