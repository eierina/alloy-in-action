This repository serves as the foundational sub-project for our series on interacting with Ethereum smart contracts using Rust. In this first example, we'll demonstrate how to use **alloy-rs** to connect to an **Anvil** instance, deploy a sample smart contract, and perform various interactions such as reading and updating contract state, handling Ether deposits, decoding events, and managing custom revert errors.

## Overview

This sub-project provides a comprehensive example of how to leverage **alloy-rs**, a Rust library for Ethereum smart contract interactions, to perform the following tasks:

1. **Connect to an Anvil Instance:** Establish a connection to a local Ethereum development node using Anvil.
2. **Deploy a Smart Contract:** Deploy a sample Solidity contract (`SampleContract`) with an initial state.
3. **Interact with the Contract:**
    - **Read State:** Retrieve the current value stored in the contract.
    - **Update State:** Change the contract's state via a transaction.
    - **Handle Ether Deposits:** Deposit Ether into the contract and verify balance changes.
    - **Decode Events:** Listen for and decode emitted events from contract interactions.
    - **Manage Custom Revert Errors:** Invoke a contract function that triggers a custom revert error and decode the error message.

The accompanying blog post delves into the details of each step, providing insights and explanations to enhance your understanding.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Deployment:** Automate the deployment process of a Solidity smart contract.
- **State Management:** Easily read and modify the contract's state variables.
- **Ether Transactions:** Handle Ether transfers to and from the contract.
- **Event Handling:** Decode and process events emitted by the contract.
- **Error Decoding:** Capture and interpret custom revert errors from contract calls.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Rust:** [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.70 or later recommended)
- **Anvil:** [Anvil Installation Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html#anvil)
- **Solidity Compiler (`solc`):** [Installation Instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/installing-solidity.html)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/in-revm-we-rust.git
   cd in-revm-we-rust/first-subproject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the required Rust crates by running:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

   This command will fetch and compile all necessary dependencies specified in the `Cargo.toml` file.

## Configuration

1. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the sub-project with the following content:

   ```env
   ANVIL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ANVIL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
   ```

    - **`ANVIL_PRIVATE_KEY`:** The private key of the account you wish to use for deploying and interacting with the contract. **Ensure this key is kept secure and never shared.**
    - **`ANVIL_RPC_URL`:** The RPC endpoint URL for your Anvil instance.

2. **Start Anvil:**

   Launch Anvil in a separate terminal window:

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

   Anvil will start a local Ethereum node listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8545` by default.

## Usage

Run the Rust application using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

This command will execute the `main` function, performing the following actions sequentially:

1. **Deploy the `SampleContract`** with an initial value of `1`.
2. **Retrieve and display** the initial value from the contract.
3. **Set the contract's value** to `2` and display the transaction hash.
4. **Fetch the transaction receipt**, decode, and handle the `ValueChanged` event.
5. **Verify and display** the updated contract value.
6. **Deposit `1 Milli-Ether`** into the contract and display relevant transaction details.
7. **Fetch and decode** the `EtherReceived` event from the deposit transaction.
8. **Retrieve and display** the updated contract and signer balances.
9. **Invoke `revertWithError`** to trigger and handle a custom revert error (`SampleError`).

## Sample Output

Upon successful execution, you should observe output similar to the following:

```plaintext

üîç Initial value retrieved from contract: 1
üîÑ Transaction sent to set new value. Transaction hash: 0xc79c2fc12f0f082ea64329538a848493658e8288806a494d4b9b94fae9ac3fc5

Ok, my first in-revm-we-rust blog post source code is ready.
```

**Note:** The exact values, especially transaction hashes and addresses, will vary based on your local Anvil setup and the specific accounts used.
